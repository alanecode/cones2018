** Guidance on screen sizes to cater for
https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/best-screen-size/

360×640 – 21.54%
1366×768 – 12.85%
1920×1080 – 7.76%
375×667 – 4.94%
1440×900 – 3.32%
1280×800 – 2.67%

** Responsive design image heights

   Full screen: 100% height
   Tall: 66% height
   Medium: 50% height
   Short: 33% height

** Resolution switching, responsive images

** Strategy
- For small phones, image should take up all of screen below the top banner,
  which itself occupies 85 vertical pixels

*** Smallest phone (iPhone5)
- Dimensions = 320x568
- Image height: 483 (full screen)

*** Most popular phone 
- Dimensions = 360×640
- Image height: 555 (full screen)

*** Big phone (e.g. iphone 7 or 8)
- Dimensions = 375x667
- Image height: 582

*** Enormous phone (iphone 7 or 8 plus)
- Dimension = 414x736
- Image height: 651

*** iPad
Between navigation and banner, occupy half of screen length
- Dimension = 768x1024
- Image height: (1024/2) - 85 = 427


*** Most popular desktop
- Dimensions = 1366×768
- Image height = 1366/4 = 341
