      <h4>What are Non-Equilibrium Systems?</h4>
      <div>
	<p>
	  How do we understand whether epidemics will spread, or predict the
	  likelihood of extreme meteorological events? How do we optimize the
	  design of nanoparticles to maximize efficiency in drug and gene
	  delivery? How do we control heating in fast electronic devices, or
	  understand how next generation solar cells might work? Can we detect
	  whether a network of financial institutions is close to a crash? Can
	  we predict the fate of cellular states in health and disease? These
	  research challenges all relate to <b>non-equilibrium systems</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Such systems are typically irreversible, e.g. because they dissipate
	  energy persistently pumped in from the outside, or they age towards
	  an equilibrium state that is never reached. They also frequently
	  exhibit extreme events, such as cascades of collective failure or the
	  thermally activated rare event of a drug molecule being released from
	  a vesicle.
	</p>

	<h4>Crossing discipline boundaries</h4>
	<p>
	  As the examples above show, the challenge of understanding
	  non-equilibrium systems is central to a wide variety of problems
	  across the spectrum of physical, mathematical, biological and
	  environmental sciences. Significant advances will have to come from
	  researchers capable of exploiting and enhancing these
	  interdisciplinary links.
	</p>

	<h4>CONES and CANES</h4>
	<p>
	  The mission of the EPSRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training in
	  Cross-Disciplinary Approaches to Non-Equilibrium Systems
	  (<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/noneqsys/index.aspx"
	  target="_blank">CANES</a>) is to train future research leaders in the
	  understanding, control and design of systems far from equilibrium,
	  based on rigorous training in theoretical modelling, simulation and
	  data-driven analysis, and a breadth of awareness of common themes
	  across disciplines.
	</p>
	<p>
	  CANES also functions as a UK Centre of Excellence for the research
	  and research user community, and a national and international hub in
	  the area of non-equilibrium systems. As part of this agenda it
	  organises the biennial CONES meetings. CANES is part of a wider
	  effort to further research into Non-Equilibrium Systemsâ€” the Centre
	  for Non-Equilibrium Science (<a href="https://cnes.kcl.ac.uk"
	  target="_blank">CNES</a>).
