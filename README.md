# CONES 2018 website

This is a repository to contain work on the website for the 2018 CONES conference to be held in June 2018. We are using the website for the [2016 CONES conference](https://conesconference.weebly.com) as a starting point, but developing it ourselves rather than using a canned website generator.

We're using the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) platform for all server-side programming, [EJS](http://ejs.co) for HTML templating and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) CSS templating.
